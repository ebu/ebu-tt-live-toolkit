The conformance requirements for EBU-TT Part 3 derive from the specification itself, EBU-TT Part 1, TTML1SE and their referenced specifications - SMIL, XSL-FO etc. The following normative statements are present in Tech 3370:

## SHALL requirements

|ID|Section|Statement|Feature file path and Scenario name|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Tech3370**| | |
| R1|2.2|When presenting a sequence of documents, at each moment in time exactly zero or one document shall be active.| |
| R2|2.2 |If no document is active, or if a document with no content is active, no content shall be displayed. | |
| R3|2.2 |Sequences shall be considered distinct if they have had processing applied, even if the result of that processing is no change other than a known difference in state, for example if the processing has checked the spelling of the text content.| |
| R4|2.2 |Every distinct sequence shall have a unique sequence identifier.| |
| R5|2.2 |A document shall be associated with exactly one sequence.| |
| R6|2.2 |the sequence identifier shall be present within every document|`bdd/features/validation/sequence\_id\_num.feature` `(In)valid Sequence head attributes`|
| R7|2.2 |Documents with the same sequence identifier shall contain a sequence number.|`bdd/features/validation/sequence\_id\_num.feature` `(In)valid Sequence head attributes`|
| R8|2.2 |Every distinct document with the same sequence identifier shall have a different sequence number.| |
| R9|2.2 |Sequence numbers shall increase with the passage of time for each new document that is made available.| |
|R10|2.2 |Every document in a sequence shall be valid and self-contained.| |
|R11|2.2 |Every document in a sequence shall have an identical timing model as defined by using the same values for the `ttp:timeBase` and `ttp:clockMode` attributes. (Note issue to add `frameRate`, `frameRateMultiplier` and `dropMode` to this attribute set)| |
|R12|2.2 |A passive node shall NOT modify input sequences and shall only emit sequences that are identical (including the sequence numbers) to the input sequence(s)| |
|R13|2.2 |At any moment in the presentation of a sequence by a node exactly zero or one document shall be temporally active.| |
|R14|2.3.1|At any single moment in time during the presentation of a sequence either zero documents or one document shall be active.| |
