|R125|2.4.2|On receiving a valid input document, if `T` is null or `T` is not null and the input documentโs `ebuttp:authorsGroupControlToken` is greater than `T`, the Handover Manager shall execute the following sub steps in this order: 1) set `T` to the input documentโs `ebuttp:authorsGroupControlToken`; 2) set `Ss` to the input documentโs sequence identifier. 3) If and only if the input documentโs sequence identifier equals `Ss` then execute the following steps in this order: 3a) generate an output document based on the input document, setting the output documentโs sequence identifier to `So` and allocating a valid sequence number greater than the most recently emitted sequence number, and adding an `ebuttm:authorsGroupSelectedSequenceIdentifier` attribute set to `Ss`; 3b) emit the output document. |`bdd/features/handover/handover_algorithm.feature`|
