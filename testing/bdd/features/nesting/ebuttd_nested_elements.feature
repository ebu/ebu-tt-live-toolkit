Feature: Merging nested elements


    Scenario: If a div contains no tt:p elements it is discarded
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And all divs contain at least one p element

        Examples:
            | xml_file                      |
            | nested_elements_hardcoded.xml |

    Scenario: No div should contain any other divs
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And no div contains any other divs

        Examples:
            | xml_file                      |
            | nested_elements_hardcoded.xml |

    Scenario: When the P region matches the div region, remove p region
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When it has div_region <div_region>
        And it has p1_region <p1_region>
        And the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And p elements do not have a region

        Examples:
            | xml_file                      | div_region | p1_region |
            | p_regions_nested_elements.xml | R1         | R1        |

    Scenario: When the P region does not match the div region, remove p
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When it has div_region <div_region>
        And it has p1_region <p1_region>
        And it has p2_region <p2_region>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And there is one div containing one p

        Examples:
            | xml_file                      | div_region | p1_region | p2_region |
            | p_regions_nested_elements.xml | R1         | R1        | R2        |

    Scenario: No span should contain any other span
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And no span contains any other spans

        Examples:
            | xml_file                   |
            | nested_spans_hardcoded.xml |

    Scenario: Nested spans with styles should create new, combined styles
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And the second span's style is outerinnerYellow

        Examples:
            | xml_file                   |
            | nested_spans_hardcoded.xml |

    Scenario: New styles are not created where the values of the new style match an existing one
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And there is no style named "nestnest"

        Examples:
            | xml_file                   |
            | nested_spans_hardcoded.xml |

    Scenario: Nested styles with percentage sizes are correctly calculated
        Given an xml file <xml_file>
        When the document is generated
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is denested
        And the EBU-TT-Live document is converted to EBU-TT-D
        Then EBUTTD document is valid
        And any span with the style "nestSizing" also has the style "autogenFontStyle_None_50.0"
        And any span with the style "nestSizingnestSizing" also has the style "autogenFontStyle_None_25.0"
        And any span with the style "nestSizingnestSizingnestSizing" also has the style "autogenFontStyle_None_12.5"

        Examples:
            | xml_file                   |
            | nested_spans_hardcoded.xml |
