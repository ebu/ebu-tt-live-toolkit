Feature: Sequence ID and Sequence Number
  Both are mandatory parameters and the sequence number has to be a number (no letters)

  # SPEC-CONFORMANCE: R6 R7 R34 R35 R36
  Scenario: Invalid Sequence head attributes
    Given an xml file <xml_file>
    When it has sequence identifier <seq_id>
    And it has sequence number <seq_n>
    Then document is invalid

    Examples:
    | xml_file            | seq_id    | seq_n |
    | sequence_id_num.xml |           | 5     |
    | sequence_id_num.xml | testSeq1  | a     |
    | sequence_id_num.xml | testSeq1  | -5    |
    | sequence_id_num.xml | testSeq1  |       |
    | sequence_id_num.xml |           |       |
    | sequence_id_num.xml | *?Empty?* |       |
    | sequence_id_num.xml | *?Empty?* | 5     |
